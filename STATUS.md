# Aletheia — Implementation Status

**As of:** 2026-08-24 (the custody anchor crosses the platform boundary — the vault root is DELIVERED over the firmware configuration channel on all three targets (QEMU fw_cfg: ioports under q35+OVMF, MMIO on both virt machines), through one door that names every impostor — absent, firmware-absent, wrong-size, foreign-root, rolled-back — with a THIRD rootless boot in each gate proving absence seals the vault while the machine continues, and the combined-transaction question DECIDED: paired commits write the vault generation into the durable entity-store record so even a consistent older VAULT-pair rollback is caught BY NAME (ADR-072); before that: authority custody is a LIFECYCLE, not a caller-supplied key — the persisted registry gains `capvault`: a versioned data-key keystore sealed with in-tree RFC 8439 ChaCha20-Poly1305 under a root-derived subkey the vault alone retains, one-way rotation whose retirement DESTROYS the retired key, constructed prefix||counter nonces reserved before use because the kernel has no boot entropy, a three-commit rekey pivot crash-proved at EVERY recorded device-op position, and 17 custody invariants on every boot of all three targets — the custody half of ALET-P1-034 over authority, ADR-070; before that: encryption at rest is a LIFECYCLE, not a key file — the hosted semantic store gains versioned data keys under a root-derived keystore with rotation/rekey/retirement, constructed prefix||counter nonces whose ledger is the authenticated log itself, position-bound AEAD frames that refuse reordering/deletion/duplication with the position named, plaintext-SHA-256 identity semantics proved in both directions, and transparent wholesale migration of pre-ADR-069 logs detected by trial-authentication — closing the P1-028/029/030 trio over the store, ADR-069; before that: the supply chain is VERIFIED, LIVE, and RECORDED — chain verification crosses the installation boundary: root→signing-key→component provenance is enforced at install against public keys only, admitted entities record their full evidence, the launch gate re-judges that evidence against CURRENT trust so signer revocation goes live at the next launch, all faults are named per link, and the spawn path — found skipping provenance entirely, ALET-P2-050 — now passes the same gate, ADR-067; before that: the component DECLARES what it speaks — the ABI is explicitly versioned: a custom-section declaration enforced at BOTH gates, install refusing undeclared/malformed/foreign-version modules before their bytes are stored and run re-checking on every path, refusals naming both sides of a version disagreement, in...

**Milestone delivered:** M1 — Hosted System-Core Reference (Rust); **P2 (start)** — WASM capability-secure component runtime; **P4 (start)** — bootable microkernel on THREE CPU targets, VM-tested: aarch64 (bootstrap) + AMD64/x86-64 (first-class) + **RISC-V/RV64GC (first-class)**; **P5 (start)** — real memory management: physical page-frame allocator + MMU virtual memory (identity map + dynamic map/unmap) + **EL0 user-mode with a capability-gated syscall boundary, hardware address-space isolation, per-process address spaces (separate TTBR0), and preemptive multitasking (full trap-frame context switch + round-robin scheduler + GICv2/generic-timer IRQ preemption)**, VM-tested on the aarch64 dev backend
**Maturity:** `docs/MATURITY.md` grades every subsystem Proved / Implemented / Architecture and states
plainly that **nothing here is production-ready** — read it before quoting any claim below.

## Current wave — the custody anchor crosses the platform boundary (2026-08-24, ADR-072)

ALET-P1-034 closes completely. DELIVERY: \`kernel-core/src/bootroot.rs\` + per-target fw_cfg
transports hand the vault its 32-byte root over the platform channel; only Delivered(exactly 32)
opens a vault, and RootNotProvided / FirmwareAbsent / MalformedRoot are refused BY NAME. DECISION:
image and entity store stay two commits but are mutually detectable — each paired commit writes
the vault generation inside the durable entity record, and custody-open enforces
witnessed_generation <= keystore_counter, converting ADR-070's pinned undetectable residual into
a named refusal. Proofs: host sweeps in tests/bootroot.rs (lying directories, truncations,
wrong sizes, constructed pair-rollback, fault-at-every-pair-position) plus [vault] ALL 14
CUSTODY-DELIVERY INVARIANTS HOLD on real firmware + real persistent media on all three targets.
Every QEMU gate gained a THIRD rootless boot proving absence seals the vault while the machine
continues; marker maps gained vault=14 deliberately (ADR-061). Heap grew 8 -> 12 MiB on the DT
targets to hold the resident custody state (ADR-063 posture).

## Current wave — the IOMMU contract is modeled, not assumed (2026-08-23, ADR-071)

ALET-P1-018 advances: `kernel-core/src/iommu.rs` defines and proves the full enforcement semantics
of a hardware IOMMU as a software model (`SoftIommu`), so every proof runs on the host today and
a hardware implementation must satisfy the same contract. Nine invariants boot on all three
targets; seven are pinned cross-CPU. The gate-marker map changed deliberately (`iommu=9`).
Hardware realization (VT-d/SMMUv3 programming) stays scoped in the gap register.


## Current wave — authority custody is a lifecycle, not a caller-supplied key (2026-08-23, ADR-070)


The custody and rotation halves of ALET-P1-034 close, because they were one gap: `capstore` could
authenticate a persisted registry only under a key the CALLER handed in on every call, so custody
was nobody's, rotation was impossible, and every boot re-asked the question a keystore exists to
answer. The constraint that shaped everything: the kernel has NO entropy source at boot, so
randomness could not be the mechanism — the lifecycle had to be safe BY CONSTRUCTION.

* **The root is custody; working keys are derived.** `CapVault::open` takes the 32-byte root once,
## Gates executed in CI

Both pipelines (GitHub Actions and GitLab CI) execute exactly these scripts, each asserted by
scripts/check-ci-parity.sh against this file: scripts/build-all.sh (every crate on its own
toolchain, host crates tested), scripts/check-boundary-docs.sh, scripts/check-ci-parity.sh,
scripts/check-register.sh, scripts/check-traceability.sh, scripts/comparative-bench.sh,
scripts/conformance.sh (the cross-CPU core contract), scripts/console-agent-e2e.sh,
scripts/console-ai-e2e.sh, scripts/console-e2e.sh, scripts/keyboard-e2e.sh,
scripts/quality-gate.sh, and the four VM gates — scripts/vm-e2e.sh (aarch64),
scripts/vm-e2e-riscv.sh (RISC-V), scripts/vm-e2e-x86.sh (x86-64 under OVMF) and
scripts/vm-e2e-vbox.sh (VirtualBox, the second-hypervisor rung).
